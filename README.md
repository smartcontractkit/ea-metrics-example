# Suggested External Adapter Metrics Dashboards and Alters

This is an example setup of Chainlink External Adapaters metrics along with Grafana dashboards and AlterManager alters. See the full guide [here](https://chainlink.notion.site/EA-Metrics-Guide-43e2b05f81494b7d8cc0f569c1b84114)

## Contributions

The repository allows for external pull requests from the general public.  This is to encourage node operators to contribute their own metrics dashboards and alters which can be used by other node operators.
External pull requests will be periodically reviewed by the Chainlink Labs Product Integrations team.  Newly suggested dashboards may then be added to this repository if they are deemed to be helpful and relevant for other node operators.

### How to Make Contributions

Contributions to this repository should be made in the form of a pull requests that add new metrics dashboards to the `/dashboards` directory or changes to the `rules.yml` file which add additional alerts.  For information on how to configure dashboards and alters, see [this section](https://www.notion.so/chainlink/EA-Metrics-Guide-43e2b05f81494b7d8cc0f569c1b84114#9bec5e322e054d84b03c17e782ed3d70) of the setup guide.

When opening a pull request, ensure that a description is included which describes each of the dashboards or alters which have been added.  These additions should be formatted as separate bullet points for each dashboard or alert which has been added.  This will enabled members of the Product Engineering team to quickly understand the contributions and expedite the process adding them to the repository.
